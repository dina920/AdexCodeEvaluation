# AdexCodeEvaluation

>Used: Java in Eclipse, spark, jdbc, mysql. The requests were sent from POSTMAN.

>POSTMAN JSON tests: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/c3d58b4e7d76d9e5b7b4

>I used MYSQL database(customers.sql)

*****I have made a few assumptions:*****
- userID in request is userAgent
- customerID is needed for the update/insert to the table, and if I have this field missing I don't keep the information
